# Document-Reterival-System-Algorithms
Document Reterival System that helps in reterival of relevant documents from the corpus based on user query.

Following are the main accomplishments and things that I have implemented in project : - 
 
 Built a java application using Eclipse that helps in retrieval of relevant ranked documents from a corpus

 Using effective data structures in vector space model, indexed the documents in such a manner that relevant documents can be retrieved from the corpus in a minimal amount of time

 Used PageRank and other sorting algorithms to sort the documents on the basis of their relevance to users query
